Potato Disease Predictor
Overview
The Potato Disease Predictor is a machine learning-based web application designed to detect and classify potato diseases from images of potato plant leaves. This project aims to assist farmers and agricultural researchers in identifying diseases early, which can help in taking preventive measures and improving crop yield.

Features
Image-based classification: Upload an image of a potato leaf, and the app will predict the type of disease (if any).
Model: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of potato leaf images.
Real-time predictions: Get disease predictions quickly with a user-friendly web interface.
FastAPI Backend: The app uses FastAPI for the backend and API serving.
Deployment-ready: Easily deployable on platforms like Heroku, AWS, or GCP.
Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of potato leaf images labeled with different diseases. The primary categories include:

Early Blight
Late Blight
Healthy
Technologies Used
FastAPI: For creating the API.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the machine learning model.
Pillow: For image processing.
Uvicorn: For serving the FastAPI app.
Docker: For containerization (if used in deployment).
Heroku/Streamlit (optional): For deployment.
